It&rsquo;s short and sweet, and using multiple recursion and list filtering to solve it takes a hell of a lot of the work out of it.

Repeatedly.)</p>\n\n<p>The book of course uses it as an example of the power of recursion, and it is indeed a good example of where clever use of that can do a lot in very little space (though personally I think the lazy factorial method is a cooler example), but the thing is that any language that implements good recursion can do the same algorithm and just as fast.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, Racket can do the exact same algorithm in just a few more lines (most of them in this case for clarity and convenience, semantically it&rsquo;s <em>almost</em> identical [but not quite, and I&rsquo;ll get to why]).</p>\n\n<div class=\"brush: racket\">\n <table class=\"sourcetable\">\n  <tbody>\n   <tr>\n    <td class=\"linenos\">\n     <div class=\"linenodiv\">\n      <pre>1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8</pre></div></td>\n    <td class=\"code\">\n     <div class=\"source\">\n      <pre><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/define.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._define))\" style=\"color: inherit\">define</a> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">qs</span> <span class=\"nv\">lst</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/if.html#(form._((quote._~23~25kernel)._if))\" style=\"color: inherit\">if</a> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/list..rkt)._empty~3f))\" style=\"color: inherit\">empty?</a></span> <span class=\"nv\">lst</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n      <span class=\"nv\">lst</span>\n      <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/let.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/letstx-scheme..rkt)._let*))\" style=\"color: inherit\">let*</a> </span><span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nf\">hd</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._car))\" style=\"color: inherit\">car</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">lst</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n             <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">tl</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._cdr))\" style=\"color: inherit\">cdr</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">lst</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n             <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">smaller</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">qs</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._for/list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">for/list</a></span> <span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nf\">i</span> <span class=\"nv\">tl</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"kd\">#:when</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3c~3d))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&lt;=</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">i</span> <span class=\"nv\">hd</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"nv\">i</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n             <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">larger</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\">qs</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/for.html#(form._((lib._racket/private/base..rkt)._for/list))\" style=\"color: inherit\">for/list</a></span> <span class=\"p\">((</span><span class=\"nf\">i</span> <span class=\"nv\">tl</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"kd\">#:when</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/generic-numbers.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._~3e))\" style=\"color: inherit\">&gt;</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">i</span> <span class=\"nv\">hd</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"nv\">i</span><span class=\"p\">))))</span>\n\t\t <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nf\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((lib._racket/list..rkt)._flatten))\" style=\"color: inherit\">flatten</a></span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._cons))\" style=\"color: inherit\">cons</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">smaller</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nb\"><a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#(def._((quote._~23~25kernel)._cons))\" style=\"color: inherit\">cons</a> </span><span class=\"nv\">hd</span> <span class=\"nv\">larger</span><span class=\"p\">))))))</span>\n</pre></div>\n</td></tr></tbody></table>\n</div>\n\n<p>So clearly, it&rsquo;s not exactly the <em>recursion</em> that makes the example so cool. No, what makes the Haskell version cool is when you realize what it can do that our Racket port can&rsquo;t: anything but numbers. The Haskell quicksort can readily handle numbers, strings, or lists of chars, all thanks to the power of this line right here:</p>\n\n<p><code>quicksort :: (Ord a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Especially</em> the <code>(Ord a)</code> bit: that&rsquo;s the Ord typeclass, which imports types that Haskell knows how to put in order, thus allowing a statically typed language to still nonetheless use the same &lt;= operator regardless of what type is actually being fed it (the other part of that feat is the <code>[a]</code> bit, the generics).</p>\n\n<p>To be able

has become a higher-order function, and must be passed the less-than function it will use to find <em>smaller</em> as well as negate to find <em>larger</em>. But it&rsquo;s still not exactly replicated the feat that Haskell&rsquo;s version would, and doing so directly would mean a whole range of type checks. It is almost certainly possible, but not in so concise a manner.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, some of this difference comes from Haskell&rsquo;s special little rules, like lists being mono-typed elements (as opposed to Racket&rsquo;s free-wheeling ones); this is more limiting but also means that functions like quicksort can largely be written to assume a list will behave with it. If we pass it a list from elsewhere in our program, it will still work as long as its members are members of Ord.</p>\n\n<p>The amusing footnote to this is that the easy solution for Racket is to make it a higher-order function (and in fact, this is even what Racket&rsquo;s built-in <a href=\"http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/pairs.html#%28def._%28%28lib._racket%2Fprivate%2Flist..rkt%29._sort%29%29\">sort</a> does), whereas in <em>Learn You a Haskell</em> the author doesn&rsquo;t even get to higher-order functions until the chapter after the quicksort example.</p>")) ((? . 1) f post (u .

I feel like I actually want to <em>do</em> something about the shit that&rsquo;s going on, besides just spreading the word about it and condemning it. That is, to me, literally the least I can do. Hell, if I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> do that, I&rsquo;d think rather ill of myself, frankly.</p>\n\n<p>I am merely a writer, ultimately, be it in code, in prose, or in games. And as I said before, when all the tools you have are words, but the jackals have not ears to hear or eyes to read those words, it can feel like a bit of a useless talent. Instead perhaps the best I can do is, if not contributing to the fight for equality necessarily, at least to the fight for a better class of game that speaks to broader themes and more inclusive worlds than more manshoots and bald-man-saves-the-world games. Recent events have really done havoc to my motivation and enthusiasm for gaming; but maybe if I can write something I <em>am</em> enthusiastic about, it might come back. If good writing and creativity are &ldquo;killing games&rdquo;, then maybe I should take up the hatchet as well&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m curious what others think, especially those women who&rsquo;re facing this mess. What can I do? Or even, <em>should</em> I be doing anything other than what I have been; after all, it&rsquo;s your voice far more than mine that needs to be heard right now.</p>")) ((? . 5) f post (u .

"\n<p>In the wake of recent events in the gaming sphere, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a good hard think. Harassment on the internet is becoming a major societal problem. People&rsquo;s lives are being threatened. Women are bombarded with abuse on an unconscionable scale. Something needs to be done: we can talk until we&rsquo;re blue in the face about why sending someone violent threats and harassment is wrong, but the harassers aren&rsquo;t listening.</p>\n\n<p>What we need, is an abuse filter.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>Since the public birth of the internet, millions, possibly even billions of dollars have been spent in pursuit of building a better spam filter. Countless man-hours have been dedicated to finding new ways of identifying and properly filing away to /dev/null the endless torrent of garbage emails about Viagra and Nigerian princes.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, where are the millions spent on solutions for internet harassment? The countless man-or-woman-hours poured into making life on the internet less an endless free-fire zone for abusive sociopaths?</p>\n\n<p>Most existing social media systems rely entirely on user reporting, essentially leaving it to the user to manually report and block each and every abusive message. This is about as ludicrous a task to demand as it would be for spam. Especially for those targeted by concerted campaigns like #gamergate/#quinnspiracy, this is more or less an intractable problem. Props aplenty for the courage of women like Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian who&rsquo;ve stuck it out and even done that work, but they never should&rsquo;ve had to do it in the first place, and many choose simply to leave rather than deal with it. Some very talented women and men alike have literally quit gaming entirely over this kind of harassment, and similar incidents have occured elsewhere in any number of fields.</p>\n\n<p>What we need is something that takes the burden of policing one&rsquo;s own timelines and inboxes off of the user, just as spam filters do for advertising and scams.</p>\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s an important difference here: ignoring spam has little consequence. Ignoring violent threats can be dangerous, and even ignoring mundane harassment often sends the message that such behavior is itself without consequence.</p>\n\n<p>Thus unlike a spam filter which simply consigns a useless message to a dustbin, an abuse filter would need to properly file and report abusive and threatening messages, possibly even for reporting to legal authorities. It needs to be smart enough to know not just what an abusive message is, but what to <em>do</em> about it.</p>\n\n<p>This also would require some cooperation from service providers, however, not all of which even provide such avenues. A Twitter client, for instance, would need to be able to report a user as abusive, yet the Twitter APIs, that I can see, do not appear to support reporting a user for abuse, only for spam.</p>\n\n<p>I am just one guy, a relative amateur at that. This is a large problem that will require brilliant minds, lots of man hours, and probably more resources than I have at my disposal. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t get it started. I intend to take a crack at developing a simple filtering engine to file and classify abusive messages given the pair of an identifying username and the text of the message. I&rsquo;ll be doing it in Racket, because I think the tools Racket offers for parsing might offer some clever avenues for solutions to such problems.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s likely to be unimpressive, and it&rsquo;s likely to bring grumbles about the choice of language, the simplicity of the model, and on and on. That&rsquo;s the point. Consider it my challenge. A first effort to get the ball rolling, with the tacit expectation that you indeed can do better: so prove it.</p>\n\n<p>Work begins soon, announcements and github repo pending.

I fall more in love with Lisp the more I learn of it, but choosing a flavor of it has tormented me more than perhaps it should.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I have learned.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>There are a dizzying array of Lisps out there, but by and large the main options boil down to the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Common Lisp</li>\n <li>Scheme</li>\n <li>Clojure</li>\n <li>Racket</li></ul>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s more of course, Paul Graham has Arc which powers Hacker News, there&rsquo;s the venerable Emacs Lisp that powers the very editor I write these posts on, but those four are probably the most prominent and feasible for at least some practical amount of actual work.</p>\n\n<p>I started with Common Lisp. Or at least, attempting it. I suspect many people do, those that don&rsquo;t instead get exposed to Scheme in college. I suspect now I understand why so many come away with a bad impression. Common Lisp is far easier to learn now than it was 10 years ago, but it&rsquo;s still a dialect built on compromises and mired in ancient and cthonian syntax. I found myself stymied by having to learn 12 different ways of doing any given thing, and by chapter-long exercises done entirely in a REPL that then crashed or fell victim to an error somewhere back on page 2.</p>\n\n<p>So, from there I cast around and found Racket. And lo, the heavens did open, and mine eyes did see the light. While I did catch glimpses of the power of Lisp with my initial toolings, it was in the purity and clarity of Racket, in its wonderful documentation, in the easy power of the Lisp&ndash;1, that I found the full breadth of what I&rsquo;d seen as I stumbled through the CL wilderness. I played and tinkered and hacked. I wrote an <a href=\"https://github.com/jarcane/MicroMini\">8-bit VM</a> in just 206 lines of code. 206!</p>\n\n<p>But I stumbled as well. I ran into problems implementing terminal i/o with my virtual machine, so it would only run in Linux. I found myself frustrated by the lack of mature development for pretty common &ldquo;getting work done&rdquo; tasks, at least for the kind of work I wanted to do. As well, I found myself stymied by the books and documentation; put off by the beginner material, but utterly baffled by the advanced features.</p>\n\n<p>I made another run at Common Lisp, getting pretty far in Peter Seibel&rsquo;s excellent <a href=\"http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/\">Practical Common Lisp</a>. Ultimately though, more exposure to the many-splendored weirdness of CL ultimately lead me to think perhaps it just wasn&rsquo;t the flavor for me.</p>\n\n<p>Another friend had mentioned Clojure. I was put off by Clojure up until now, because it reeked of startup culture and I frankly have a long-standing grudge against Java. But Java is practically the reigning Lord and Master of the mobile-heavy Finnish scene, and it seemed to be driving a lot of new adoption locally and even a few actual jobs.</p>\n\n<p>So, I discussed it with my wife and we mutually agreed I should give it a shot. I meditated upon the <a href=\"http://clojurescriptkoans.com/\">ClojureScript Koans</a>, and was initially quite intrigued by its #() and its funcional purity, if a bit baffled by the sheer number of different data types, and put off by the ugly syntax. I code-golfed a FizzBuzz in a tweet done in CS. I then thought I should meditate upon the full <a href=\"https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans\">Clojure Koans</a> in order to learn those things which CS had by necessity neglected.</p>\n\n<p>By the end, the only &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; I found there was the cold burning focus of pure fury. I hated its clunky implementation, it&rsquo;s utter violation of the purity I so loved in a Lisp. I hated how utterly inconsistent everything was. I hated how any error could spell utter doom to your entire system, as typo&rsquo;d recursions led to full CPUs and runaway threads. I hate hate hated the threading macro with the fire of a thousand incandescent supernovas.</p>\n\n<p>However, it also gave me a sense of perspective, and so I meditated on the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/lisp-koans\">Common Lisp Koans</a>. There I faced a an anticlimax. The final meditation was on SBCL threads, and SBCL threads were like grasping a stream of water. I had recieved all the enlightenment that Common Lisp seemed ready to offer.</p>\n\n<p>And in the end, all I wanted was my Racket back. The prodigal son wanted to come home.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that in the cold light of reason I could find work in Clojure or Common Lisp. I do indeed envy their library support, and have come to respect a number of those features that they offer, and may even seek to reimplement some of them in my own Racket set up.</p>\n\n<p>It is true as well that Racket is not well represented in the world of working programmers. But it is well represented in the world of computer science, a world I increasingly suspect I might like to enter if I should prove worthy. While there is something of a gap between the &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; levels of the Racket world, the flipside to this is that it is stuffed with incredibly brilliant people who are almost to a one the most polite and helpful people I&rsquo;ve met since returning to programming.</p>\n\n<p>So, with at least a year of language courses before I can even think about a job or university, why not hang around and contribute and learn in a place where I feel most at home? It was Python being this for me that made me a programmer again, and I think it could be Racket doing so that makes me a <em>good</em> one.</p>")) ((? . 12) f post (u .

A crucial time, one I&rsquo;m frankly wrestling with. When learning (or re-learning) a new skill, there&rsquo;s a point at which the &ldquo;good start&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve made is actually a hindrance. You <em>can</em> become a programmer in 28 days.</p>\n\n<p>You might even be decent at it, given some more practice, if you&rsquo;ve the head for it and all you want to do is be a <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html\">&ldquo;Blub&rdquo;</a> coder for life. In the old days this was how a lot of working programmers got started, and cubicle farms the world over are similarly filled with these. The local Java apprenticeship program I think lasts all of three months. Many so-called &ldquo;hacker schools&rdquo; and &ldquo;bootcamps&rdquo; more or less crash-course young minds through an easy language like Ruby or Python in a matter of weeks and send them off into the world $10,000 poorer and with all the coding knowledge of the average Codecademy user.</p>\n\n<p>To be a <em>good</em> one, though, even a <em>great</em> one, you need to be willing to set aside that &ldquo;good start&rdquo; and keep building back on the fundamentals again and again. And when you already have that start, when you already feel like you <em>are</em> &ldquo;good enough,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s incredibly hard to force yourself to go back to feeling like you&rsquo;ve no idea what you&rsquo;re doing all over again.</p>\n\n<p>I programmed when I was younger, quite a lot in fact, and that skill never quite decays, so that plus some great re-introductory material seemed to be catapulting me into the stratosphere at a rate not dissimilar from my foray into book publishing. There was a window when I think I was even getting a bit cocky about it. Racket was good for breaking this. The basics of Racket are as easy to grasp as any other, probably the easiest Lisp to learn, with some pretty good intro books and guides. But those advanced topics, the language tools, the contracts, the dialects, all hang there in the Guide sidebar reminding you of just how much more there is to learn. And hanging out with the PLT crew, and the #esolang hackers, and other similarly smart folk (seriously the smartest people I&rsquo;ve ever met in programming were either esolang nerds or Lispers or one flavor or another), is also hugely eye-opening for a cocky young sprat.</p>\n\n<p>This is all one reason why I&rsquo;ve picked up quite a bit of backlog of books to study, probably enough to fill a year&rsquo;s university curriculum at a minimum. Now that the rambling phase of the post is over, I thought it might be useful to someone or simply for posterity to catalog my current &ldquo;learn stack&rdquo;. These are the books I want to tackle in the near-ish future, though in what order and which next is still the subject of some debate.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/\">How To Design Programs</a> - I&rsquo;ve started this book twice. Both times I&rsquo;ve got impatient or distracted and gone on to something that seemed to be leading me towards more direct progress; it has a very particular style of design it teaches that I found a bit odd, and the focus on &ldquo;learning languages&rdquo; was a bit frustrating when all I really wanted to do was learn more about Racket proper.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-1.html\">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> - Anyone who is reading this probably already is at least familiar with this name. It seems to be perhaps one of the most well-regarded books on programming and CS there is; almost no one I&rsquo;ve ever spoken to about it had anything but glowing praise, even the ones who didn&rsquo;t even write Scheme or Lisp anymore. I&rsquo;m definitely curious, especially as it covers a lot of systems programming stuff that seems to be where my mind wants to go as a programmer. (For similar reasons, I&rsquo;m also really interested in <a href=\"http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/\">PLAI</a>)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/\">Build Your Own Lisp</a> - An unusual approach for a new language introduction, this book aims to teach the reader C by walking them through the development of a dialect of Lisp. I&rsquo;m a bit suspicious of some of the design decisions (it controversially avoids dealing with quote and macros by replacing them with something called &ldquo;Q-expressions&rdquo;), but C is a good language to know and this seems like a fun way to learn it. In a similar vein, there is <a href=\"https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours\">Write Yourself A Scheme in 48 Hours</a>, which aims to give a crash course in Haskell by teaching you how to build a basic Scheme interpreter with it. This leads to my next pick:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://learnyouahaskell.com/\">Learn You a Haskel for Great Good</a> - I am deeply curious about Haskell, because I am deeply curious about functional programming and also by the unusual arcaneness of it. This book seems to be a fan favorite, as it were, and the tone is certainly inviting. There&rsquo;s also an <a href=\"http://learnyousomeerlang.com/\">Erlang book</a> inspired by it, which I&rsquo;m more interested for professional reasons: it was invented next-door, as it were, so there&rsquo;s a fair number of jobs about in Erlang still.</p>\n\n<p>I think the next book I tackle will be one of these, I just haven&rsquo;t decided which yet. I&rsquo;m very open to advice, so feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments, as opinionated as you like.</p>"))))
