&lt;p&gt;It would appear that Bootswatch has been updated to Boostrap 3, because I was able to install Slate without any apparent issue. Let me know if you notice anything. I&amp;rsquo;m also testing some issues with Frog giving me grief on builds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the quick efforts of Greg Hendershott, we now have a fix for the Windows URI path generation, so links to subpages should all work correctly now. Let me know if there&amp;rsquo;s any further problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item>

&lt;p&gt;Currently aware of an issue in Frog resulting in malformed page URLs for my posts. Users on browsers other than Chrome will get 404 errors accessing full blog pages. Greg Hendershott is aware of the issue now, and I&amp;rsquo;ll get the site patched as soon as he pushes a fix to Frog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item>

   <description>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Arcane Syntax, destined to be the new home of all things relating to the arcane art of computer programming and development, as flowing from the mind of myself, an self-trained apprentice programmer, Finnish language student, and former tabletop games writer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief subject matter of Arcane Syntax is likely at this point to be focusing especially on the Racket programming language, which has ultimately proved my favorite home in the magical land of Lisp dialects, for reasons which I shall expound upon in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been at this programming thing for but a short time, having previously not touched more than a few simple dice rollers in at least a decade. If something I should happen to post on this blog demonstrate a profound ignorance, it is likely for lack of education, and thus polite instruction is likely to be welcomed eagerly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
