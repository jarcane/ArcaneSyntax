I fall more in love with Lisp the more I learn of it, but choosing a flavor of it has tormented me more than perhaps it should.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what I have learned.</p>\n<!-- more-->\n\n<p>There are a dizzying array of Lisps out there, but by and large the main options boil down to the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n <li>Common Lisp</li>\n <li>Scheme</li>\n <li>Clojure</li>\n <li>Racket</li></ul>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s more of course, Paul Graham has Arc which powers Hacker News, there&rsquo;s the venerable Emacs Lisp that powers the very editor I write these posts on, but those four are probably the most prominent and feasible for at least some practical amount of actual work.</p>\n\n<p>I started with Common Lisp. Or at least, attempting it. I suspect many people do, those that don&rsquo;t instead get exposed to Scheme in college. I suspect now I understand why so many come away with a bad impression. Common Lisp is far easier to learn now than it was 10 years ago, but it&rsquo;s still a dialect built on compromises and mired in ancient and cthonian syntax. I found myself stymied by having to learn 12 different ways of doing any given thing, and by chapter-long exercises done entirely in a REPL that then crashed or fell victim to an error somewhere back on page 2.</p>\n\n<p>So, from there I cast around and found Racket. And lo, the heavens did open, and mine eyes did see the light. While I did catch glimpses of the power of Lisp with my initial toolings, it was in the purity and clarity of Racket, in its wonderful documentation, in the easy power of the Lisp&ndash;1, that I found the full breadth of what I&rsquo;d seen as I stumbled through the CL wilderness. I played and tinkered and hacked. I wrote an <a href=\"https://github.com/jarcane/MicroMini\">8-bit VM</a> in just 206 lines of code. 206!</p>\n\n<p>But I stumbled as well. I ran into problems implementing terminal i/o with my virtual machine, so it would only run in Linux. I found myself frustrated by the lack of mature development for pretty common &ldquo;getting work done&rdquo; tasks, at least for the kind of work I wanted to do. As well, I found myself stymied by the books and documentation; put off by the beginner material, but utterly baffled by the advanced features.</p>\n\n<p>I made another run at Common Lisp, getting pretty far in Peter Seibel&rsquo;s excellent <a href=\"http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/\">Practical Common Lisp</a>. Ultimately though, more exposure to the many-splendored weirdness of CL ultimately lead me to think perhaps it just wasn&rsquo;t the flavor for me.</p>\n\n<p>Another friend had mentioned Clojure. I was put off by Clojure up until now, because it reeked of startup culture and I frankly have a long-standing grudge against Java. But Java is practically the reigning Lord and Master of the mobile-heavy Finnish scene, and it seemed to be driving a lot of new adoption locally and even a few actual jobs.</p>\n\n<p>So, I discussed it with my wife and we mutually agreed I should give it a shot. I meditated upon the <a href=\"http://clojurescriptkoans.com/\">ClojureScript Koans</a>, and was initially quite intrigued by its #() and its funcional purity, if a bit baffled by the sheer number of different data types, and put off by the ugly syntax. I code-golfed a FizzBuzz in a tweet done in CS. I then thought I should meditate upon the full <a href=\"https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans\">Clojure Koans</a> in order to learn those things which CS had by necessity neglected.</p>\n\n<p>By the end, the only &ldquo;enlightenment&rdquo; I found there was the cold burning focus of pure fury. I hated its clunky implementation, it&rsquo;s utter violation of the purity I so loved in a Lisp. I hated how utterly inconsistent everything was. I hated how any error could spell utter doom to your entire system, as typo&rsquo;d recursions led to full CPUs and runaway threads. I hate hate hated the threading macro with the fire of a thousand incandescent supernovas.</p>\n\n<p>However, it also gave me a sense of perspective, and so I meditated on the <a href=\"https://github.com/google/lisp-koans\">Common Lisp Koans</a>. There I faced a an anticlimax. The final meditation was on SBCL threads, and SBCL threads were like grasping a stream of water. I had recieved all the enlightenment that Common Lisp seemed ready to offer.</p>\n\n<p>And in the end, all I wanted was my Racket back. The prodigal son wanted to come home.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure that in the cold light of reason I could find work in Clojure or Common Lisp. I do indeed envy their library support, and have come to respect a number of those features that they offer, and may even seek to reimplement some of them in my own Racket set up.</p>\n\n<p>It is true as well that Racket is not well represented in the world of working programmers. But it is well represented in the world of computer science, a world I increasingly suspect I might like to enter if I should prove worthy. While there is something of a gap between the &ldquo;beginner&rdquo; and &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; levels of the Racket world, the flipside to this is that it is stuffed with incredibly brilliant people who are almost to a one the most polite and helpful people I&rsquo;ve met since returning to programming.</p>\n\n<p>So, with at least a year of language courses before I can even think about a job or university, why not hang around and contribute and learn in a place where I feel most at home? It was Python being this for me that made me a programmer again, and I think it could be Racket doing so that makes me a <em>good</em> one.</p>")) ((? . 2) f post (u .

This is about as ludicrous a task to demand as it would be for spam. Especially for those targeted by concerted campaigns like #gamergate/#quinnspiracy, this is more or less an intractable problem. Props aplenty for the courage of women like Zoe Quinn and Anita Sarkeesian who&rsquo;ve stuck it out and even done that work, but they never should&rsquo;ve had to do it in the first place, and many choose simply to leave rather than deal with it. Some very talented women and men alike have literally quit gaming entirely over this kind of harassment, and similar incidents have occured elsewhere in any number of fields.</p>\n\n<p>What we need is something that takes the burden of policing one&rsquo;s own timelines and inboxes off of the user, just as spam filters do for advertising and scams.</p>\n\n<p>But there&rsquo;s an important difference here: ignoring spam has little consequence. Ignoring violent threats can be dangerous, and even ignoring mundane harassment often sends the message that such behavior is itself without consequence.</p>\n\n<p>Thus unlike a spam filter which simply consigns a useless message to a dustbin, an abuse filter would need to properly file and report abusive and threatening messages, possibly even for reporting to legal authorities. It needs to be smart enough to know not just what an abusive message is, but what to <em>do</em> about it.</p>\n\n<p>This also would require some cooperation from service providers, however, not all of which even provide such avenues. A Twitter client, for instance, would need to be able to report a user as abusive, yet the Twitter APIs, that I can see, do not appear to support reporting a user for abuse, only for spam.</p>\n\n<p>I am just one guy, a relative amateur at that. This is a large problem that will require brilliant minds, lots of man hours, and probably more resources than I have at my disposal. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t get it started. I intend to take a crack at developing a simple filtering engine to file and classify abusive messages given the pair of an identifying username and the text of the message. I&rsquo;ll be doing it in Racket, because I think the tools Racket offers for parsing might offer some clever avenues for solutions to such problems.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s likely to be unimpressive, and it&rsquo;s likely to bring grumbles about the choice of language, the simplicity of the model, and on and on. That&rsquo;s the point. Consider it my challenge. A first effort to get the ball rolling, with the tacit expectation that you indeed can do better: so prove it.</p>\n\n<p>Work begins soon, announcements and github repo pending.
