<p>It has begun.</p>

<p>In accordance with my education in the Finnish language, a portion of time, about two months, has been set aside over the summer for the students to take a &ldquo;work trial&rdquo; at a Finnish workplace. Owing to my powerful disinterest in winding up spending my summer stocking shelves at a supermarket, I naturally was quite on top of attempting to find some more suitable environment for a budding programmer, which I&rsquo;m delighted to say I did.</p>

<p>The work place in question is a firm called <a href="http://metosin.fi">Metosin</a>, a Clojure consulting firm stationed right in the heart of the city, and this week was my very first week on the job. It had, as it was, been a little while since I dove into Clojure (which anyone who&rsquo;s actually read any of this blog, ie. no one, is likely to remember), so prior to starting the job I dove into a couple web apps in anticipation of my arrival and future employment.</p>

<p>For starters, I did Ludum Dare this year, banging out a spiffy little Pok√©mon themed idler game in Hoplon, which you can find <a href="https://github.com/jarcane/trainers-progress">here</a>. Hoplon is an interesting framework, whose concept I was initially quite excited by, an excitement whose dwindling you can perhaps most likely best glean from the fact that when for my try-out task for Metosin it was suggested I use Reagent instead, I was actually more than a bit relieved.</p>

<p>This task took the form of a full-stack weather look-up application, which I in my infinite nerditude decided to call <a href="https://github.com/jarcane/wunderprojectj">wunderprojectj</a>, a reference so unutterably obscure than I&rsquo;m pretty sure no one even noticed, and if you did, perhaps I shall consider buying you a beer (and then backing slowly away into the night).</p>

<p>Since my official start date, I&rsquo;ve been at work on a simple CRUD sort of a web app for managing members of a matrikkeli organization (a term which I am obliged to indicate I&rsquo;m not entirely sure there&rsquo;s a direct translation for, but that doesn&rsquo;t really matter for the purposes of this blog anyway).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been suggested I keep some kind of log of how the work is going and what I&rsquo;ve been learning, so after the jump, I&rsquo;ll get on with how my week&rsquo;s been going.</p>
<!-- more-->

<p>The app is, by the description of my fellow co-workers, quite simple, which is to say, by the standards of anything I&rsquo;d had a personal hand in previously, it is enormously complicated. Or at least, that&rsquo;s how I felt for the first two days on the job, especially as initially my suggested task was first porting the entire front-end from Om to Reagent. I spent the bulk of the first few days just trying to get my head &rsquo;round the organization of the code base, and reading reams and reams of documentation on various libraries trying to come to grips with the moving parts and how such a task might even be approached. I had a hell of a time finding a whole lot of anything from anyone who&rsquo;s actually made such a transition, and Om and Reagent do things in very different ways; besides which I had trouble even finding many examples of an application of this scope written in Reagent. I actually wound up banging up an incredibly primitive toy Reagent app just to figure out how to refer to a single state atom across multiple files. You can see that <a href="https://github.com/jarcane/multipage-reagent">here</a> for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>

<p>In the process, I did manage to fix a couple of bugs with the user profile image display and upload, one of which (with help) was discovered to be the result of an API refactor that&rsquo;d never been translated to the actual front end calls, and the other of which was a failure in the image validation which more or less turned the image upload into an accidental file hosting service.</p>

<p>Eventually after some discussions mid-week with the rest of the crew, the scope of my responsibility was narrowed down instead to new feature implementation, which has gone a bit better, and given me a bit more opportunity to really get used to the project organization and so forth. I managed to implement a user status flag and interest tags on the back-end, and search for the latter on the front-end. Sadly I&rsquo;ve so far not yet found a way to making those user tags user-editable yet, partly I suspect because I&rsquo;m having a bit of trouble following the libraries used for the user profile form. My intent is to keep at it though, at least to get some kind of rough working prototype.</p>

<p>At this point it&rsquo;s difficult to pin down exactly how much I&rsquo;ve learned from all this, but I&rsquo;ve certainly been exposed to quite a lot of new technology, and I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;m getting a bit more comfortable with the work at least so far. On the whole, not totally unproductive for a first week.</p>
