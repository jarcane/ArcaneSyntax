    Title: Correction and refactoring

I was thinking again this evening about last week's quicksort post (which I've since even been informed isn't technically a quicksort algorithm), and decided to tinker with streamlining my Racket version a bit more to take better advantage of higher-order functions.

To my horror I realized in looking at last week's code I'd actually munged up the qs-2 version, which should look like this:

```racket
(define (qs-2 fun lst)
  (if (empty? lst)
      lst
      (let* ((hd (car lst))
             (tl (cdr lst))
             (smaller (qs-2 fun (for/list ((i tl) #:when (fun i hd)) i)))
             (larger (qs-2 fun (for/list ((i tl) #:when ((negate fun) i hd)) i))))
		 (flatten (cons smaller (cons hd larger))))))```


However, as it turns out, Racket actually has built-ins for function currying, and as well, filter's really a better (and Lispier) function here than a for loop, so we can actually match the Haskell version's line count like so.

```racket
(define (qs-3 fun lst)
  (if (empty? lst)
      lst
      (let ((smaller (qs-3 fun (filter (curryr fun          (car lst)) (cdr lst))))
            (larger  (qs-3 fun (filter (curryr (negate fun) (car lst)) (cdr lst)))))
        (flatten (cons smaller (cons (car lst) larger)))))) ```

Voila. Now we have a version that is both Lispier and makes better use of higher-order functions. Alas, we still can't universalize it in so little space (that I know of anyway). The Ord typeclass is one powerful little bugger.
