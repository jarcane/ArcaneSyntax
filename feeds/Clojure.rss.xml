   <description>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has begun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In accordance with my education in the Finnish language, a portion of time, about two months, has been set aside over the summer for the students to take a &amp;ldquo;work trial&amp;rdquo; at a Finnish workplace. Owing to my powerful disinterest in winding up spending my summer stocking shelves at a supermarket, I naturally was quite on top of attempting to find some more suitable environment for a budding programmer, which I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to say I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work place in question is a firm called &lt;a href="http://metosin.fi"&gt;Metosin&lt;/a&gt;, a Clojure consulting firm stationed right in the heart of the city, and this week was my very first week on the job. It had, as it was, been a little while since I dove into Clojure (which anyone who&amp;rsquo;s actually read any of this blog, ie. no one, is likely to remember), so prior to starting the job I dove into a couple web apps in anticipation of my arrival and future employment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, I did Ludum Dare this year, banging out a spiffy little Pok√©mon themed idler game in Hoplon, which you can find &lt;a href="https://github.com/jarcane/trainers-progress"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Hoplon is an interesting framework, whose concept I was initially quite excited by, an excitement whose dwindling you can perhaps most likely best glean from the fact that when for my try-out task for Metosin it was suggested I use Reagent instead, I was actually more than a bit relieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This task took the form of a full-stack weather look-up application, which I in my infinite nerditude decided to call &lt;a href="https://github.com/jarcane/wunderprojectj"&gt;wunderprojectj&lt;/a&gt;, a reference so unutterably obscure than I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure no one even noticed, and if you did, perhaps I shall consider buying you a beer (and then backing slowly away into the night).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my official start date, I&amp;rsquo;ve been at work on a simple CRUD sort of a web app for managing members of a matrikkeli organization (a term which I am obliged to indicate I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure there&amp;rsquo;s a direct translation for, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter for the purposes of this blog anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been suggested I keep some kind of log of how the work is going and what I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning, so after the jump, I&amp;rsquo;ll get on with how my week&amp;rsquo;s been going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The app is, by the description of my fellow co-workers, quite simple, which is to say, by the standards of anything I&amp;rsquo;d had a personal hand in previously, it is enormously complicated. Or at least, that&amp;rsquo;s how I felt for the first two days on the job, especially as initially my suggested task was first porting the entire front-end from Om to Reagent. I spent the bulk of the first few days just trying to get my head &amp;rsquo;round the organization of the code base, and reading reams and reams of documentation on various libraries trying to come to grips with the moving parts and how such a task might even be approached. I had a hell of a time finding a whole lot of anything from anyone who&amp;rsquo;s actually made such a transition, and Om and Reagent do things in very different ways; besides which I had trouble even finding many examples of an application of this scope written in Reagent. I actually wound up banging up an incredibly primitive toy Reagent app just to figure out how to refer to a single state atom across multiple files. You can see that &lt;a href="https://github.com/jarcane/multipage-reagent"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for what it&amp;rsquo;s worth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process, I did manage to fix a couple of bugs with the user profile image display and upload, one of which (with help) was discovered to be the result of an API refactor that&amp;rsquo;d never been translated to the actual front end calls, and the other of which was a failure in the image validation which more or less turned the image upload into an accidental file hosting service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually after some discussions mid-week with the rest of the crew, the scope of my responsibility was narrowed down instead to new feature implementation, which has gone a bit better, and given me a bit more opportunity to really get used to the project organization and so forth. I managed to implement a user status flag and interest tags on the back-end, and search for the latter on the front-end. Sadly I&amp;rsquo;ve so far not yet found a way to making those user tags user-editable yet, partly I suspect because I&amp;rsquo;m having a bit of trouble following the libraries used for the user profile form. My intent is to keep at it though, at least to get some kind of rough working prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to pin down exactly how much I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from all this, but I&amp;rsquo;ve certainly been exposed to quite a lot of new technology, and I&amp;rsquo;d like to think I&amp;rsquo;m getting a bit more comfortable with the work at least so far. On the whole, not totally unproductive for a first week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
